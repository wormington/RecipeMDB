# RecipeMDB
A repository for testing out MongoDB. Dataset will be a subset of recipes from [AllRecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).

The purpose of this project is to learn more about the usage and effectiveness of NoSQL (non-relational) databases as compared to SQL (relational) databases. I have previously learned about and used relational databases in college classes, but I was never taught anything about non-relational databases. A friend of mine who took the same relational database class suggested I try MongoDB, as he was quite pleased with its flexibility and ease of use. I plan to extend this README as I continue work on this project. Currently, I am reading through the MongoDB documentation to learn more about the platform.
